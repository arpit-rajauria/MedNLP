There is a 9-mm\\nhypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the\\nliver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but\\nstatistically most likely representing a cyst. There are\\nbilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal\\nin size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic\\nbody, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and\\nadrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the\\nstomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops\\nappear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral\\ncontrast material has passed into the ascending colon without\\nevidence of obstruction.

The prostate is enlarged,\\nmeasuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a\\nmoderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free\\nfluid.\\n\\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is\\nDISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine.

New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with\\nassociated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No\\nassociated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate\\nclinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.\\ninjections.\\n3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could\\nrepresent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.\\nIf this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further\\nevaluation.\\n4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too\\nsmall to accurately characterize.\\n5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.\\n6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.\\n\\nA wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed\\nby Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].\\n\\n[**2162-3-16**]\\nVIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video\\nfluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration\\nof thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the\\nspeech pathologist.\\n\\nORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue\\nmovement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.\\n\\nPHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar\\nelevation.

No new hemorrhage is identified. The\\nventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to\\ninvolutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities\\nare sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia\\nin the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is\\nunchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The\\nvisualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.\\nSkin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck\\nsecondary to recent spinal surgery.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small\\nintraventricular hemorrhage.\\n\\nNo discharge labs as patient CMO.\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nMr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height\\nof approximatly 10 feet.
